## User Stories
1. As a player, I want to be able to place different types of towers on the map so that I can use different strategies and tactics to defend against enemy waves

- There are at least 3 different types of towers that can be placed (e.g. short range, long range, air)
- Towers can be placed anywhere on the map that is not obstructed
- Towers will automatically attack incoming enemies within their range

2. As a player, I want to see waves of enemies approaching along paths on the map so that I can plan my tower placements in advance of each attack

-  Enemies spawn in waves and move along clearly defined paths on the map
- Different enemy types have different speeds and health amounts
- The number and power of enemies increases with each new wave

3. As a player, I want to be able to upgrade my towers so that I can strengthen my defenses and strategies over multiple waves of progressively harder enemies

- Towers can be upgraded to increase their range, damage, attack speed, etc.  
- Upgrades have multiple levels and cost in-game resources  
- Upgraded towers have visible effects like increased range or damage numbers  

4. As a player, I want to earn cash from defeating enemies to purchase new towers and upgrades so that I can customize and optimize my defenses over time

- Enemies drop cash when defeated
- New towers and upgrades have a displayed cost that is deducted from the player's cash on purchase  
- Cash is accumulated between waves and from upgrades to afford more powerful towers  

5. As a player, I want to see my performance rated after completing a wave so that I have a sense of progression and challenge level after each level

- Waves are clearly defined with a start and end
- After each wave, the player is given a rating (e.g. stars) based on enemy units defeated
- Losing all health from enemies reaching the end loses the game
